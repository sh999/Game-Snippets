against a computer-controlled warrior.  Each warrior has basic
attributes such as Attack, Defense, and Agility.  In the pre-battle
phase, the user inputs the values for each attribute.  The values 
can't exceed a given maximum number when summed.  After this, the 
player warrior can battle the computer warrior.

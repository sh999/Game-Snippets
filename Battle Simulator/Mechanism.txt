Battle begins between warrior1 and warrior2
Determine who inflicts damage
	Who gets to damage first depends on attack values
	Every point difference either way grants a warrior 10% advantage in hitting first
	Example:  
		
		warrior1.attack = 5
		warrior2.attack = 5
			No difference in attacks, so each warrior has a 50% chance to inflict damage
		
		warrior1.attack = 2
		warrior2.attack = 4
			warrior2 has 2 more attack points, so it has 50% + (10% * 2) = 70% of inflicting damage
Determine damage
	HP of character is by default 100
	If warrior1 successfully attacks, subtract warrior1.strength - warrior2.defense
	Use gaussian random number generator
		Tentatively, -20 to +20 of strength - defense should be the minimum and maximum
	If warrior2 is defending, warrior2 has a chance to evade the attack.  The higher its agility is vs warrior1, the higher chance of a miss.  Each difference = 10% chance of a miss

Graph-race notes

Travel decay culprit is in connection_table and gameplay

c_table:findEdgeID <- EdgeTracker:setcurrentnodeID() <- gameplay:Draw() <- Main:draw

click...
mouse is released
gameplay.mouseReleasedEvent()

traveledEdge is set in edgeTracker

findEdgeID is called by edgeTracker; it sets Pair collection, and checks it with values passed into it (start and end nodes)
	i.e. Edge tracker sends start/end node, and findEdgeID finds the Edge from that info
I see a potential proglem here, where edge decay is set during mouse released event, but edge finding happens throughout draw().  Need to have no concurrency, but to have one function controlling find edge then edge decay.

Another point of confusion: 
findEdgeID is found in EdgeTracker and ConnectionTable.  Maybe these two classes should be merged

MousePressed changes status depending on conditions

At every draw frame, gameplay.draw() is called

There are two functions that sets traveledEdge, edgetracker.setCurrentNodeID and findEdgeID
